# #nowplaying-RS: A Benchmark Dataset for Context Aware Music Recommendation

Here, you can find the codes for implementation of the experiments conducted on the #nowplaying-RS dataset.   
We have used Factorization Machines[1] to perform the music recommendation experiments.  

More details about the dataset and its contents can be found at http://dbis-nowplaying.uibk.ac.at/  

## Environment
Python 3.5  

## Dependencies  
- numpy Â   
- sklearn    
- pyfm  
- pandas  
- math  
- time  

## Code
The following scripts, stored in this repository, have been developed for the dataset.
1. [main.py](https://github.com/asmitapoddar/nowplaying-RS-Music-Recommendation-FM/blob/master/main.py): The main file from which the other scriptsare called.  
2. [group.py](https://github.com/asmitapoddar/nowplaying-RS-Music-Recommendation-FM/blob/master/group.py): The tet set is ordered according to the user_id. However, this is optional as the test set provided has already been ordered according to user_id. 
3. [load.py](https://github.com/asmitapoddar/nowplaying-RS-Music-Recommendation-FM/blob/master/load.py): Shows how to load the dataset. You can enter the attributes with which you want to train the Factorization Machine here. (In this file, the attributes user_id + track_id + tempo have been used to train the FM).  
4. [runFM.py](https://github.com/asmitapoddar/nowplaying-RS-Music-Recommendation-FM/blob/master/runFM.py): Training of the Factorization Machine takes place and prediction.
5. [calcMRR.py](https://github.com/asmitapoddar/nowplaying-RS-Music-Recommendation-FM/blob/master/calcMRR.py): Calculation of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).

## Usage

######1. Downloading.
You can download the datasets and uncompress the archives using the following commands:
```
